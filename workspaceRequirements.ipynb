    "* this shape is big, and so will likely set the overall size of the manipulation envelope.\n",
    "\n",
    "sitting sagittal:\n",
    "* the fact that the subject is sitting limits hip extension significantly, and the fact that the heel will contact the chair changes the workspace shape to be more infront of the subject. this is the second biggest shape. it can be moved left and right, and potentially altered slightly in shape by changing the height of the chair. \n",
    "\n",
    "standing frontal:\n",
    "* the location of this workspace is constrainted by it's height off the ground, with the furthest extent of the workspace being very close to the ground.\n",
    "* with useage of the robot in this position, it's advantagous for the subject to have the ability to place their hands on a handrail or support. this could take 2 forms:\n",
    "    * one, the subject can place both hands on the top of the tower, but as a result, the robot workspace will need to be availiable directly  down from the top of the tower. \n",
    "    * two, the subject can place one hand on the top of the tower, and the outer hand can be placed on a handrail or the back of a chair, with the plane of that support located in the sagittal plane. \n",
    "* in the second form of support, there aren't any left and right constraints on the workspace location, in the first case there are. \n",
    "\n",
    "sitting frontal:\n",
    "* in the seated condition, there is no left and right constraint on the workspace.\n",
    "* the up-down constraint on the workspace is that it is higher off the ground than in the standing position. \n",
    "* the mounting of the ankle to the pedal may be difficult, and the ankle will naturally want to rotate backwards about an ML axis, so that the toes are above the heel. this is not possible if mounted to the same pedal as used for both the sagittal and standing frontal cases. perhaps a fixed angle block could be used. not sure.\n",

    "* the toe of the off foot impinging on the tower limits the up-down travel of this workspace. \n",

    "* additionally from a stability standpoint, its nice to have the opposite foot firmly planted on the ground. \n",

    "* the ROM, particularly in the Anterior-Posterior direction was smaller than it might have been, due to the need to maintain balance and not apply normal force to the tower, and lack of a handrail\n",
    "* in this position, it's possible to move the workspace location up and down, but not left and right, the constraint is on the proximity to the edge of the box. "

    "# ok, this is a super important insight into the robot, that I think could solve all of our problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. the first insight is that if the robot is constructed correctly, (meaning that things don't impinge on eachother) then the robot with the elbow up and with the elbow down can be converted from one to the other on the fly. meaning, you actually have 4 robots, not one, and you can try to utilize this to your advantage.\n",
    "1. why is this important? well, of the solutions that have been emerging, some conditions are better for condition number optimization across a range, while others are better for jacobian matching. what if you did a joint optimization where you optimize for jacobian matching in one configuration, and condition number in the other, and specified that the link lengths must be the same (with the possible exception of the last link and last link angle)? then you could just pop the singularity from one config to another and be good to go. remember, that for each point in space, there are actually 4 jacobians depending on the state of the elbows. this means there are 4 possible robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "* note that for this robot, to move from a left leg to a right leg configuration requires no actual change in the robot (via dis-assembly) - just a shifting thorugh the configurations.\n",
    "* shifting between a condition number optimized configuration, and a jacobian matched configuration would require a (probably very quick ) change\n",
