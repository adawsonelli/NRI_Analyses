    "the project consists of a series of notebooks. the main notebooks are:\n",

    "* [RR force maps](RR_force_maps.ipynb) - demonstrates with 2 RR robots that the positioning of a \"human\" relative to a \"robot\" dramatically effects the haptic rendering space\n",
    "* [models](Models.ipynb) - where the models and the experiment object are defined \n",
    "* [optimizers](optimizers.ipynb) - where the different optimizers are defined \n",
    "* [Numerical Experiements](NumericalExperiments.ipynb) - different optimization experiments which constitute the content of the paper\n",

    "other notebooks were made to conduct small experiments and tests: \n",
    "\n",
    "* [tests](tests.ipynb) - experiments exploring various ideas that were critical in the construction of models, optimizer, etc.\n",
    "* [RRR_IK_locked](RRR_IK_locked.ipynb) - discussion of how I ended up solving IK for an RRR robot with joint locked\n",
    "* [sympy_human_IK](sympy_human_IK.ipynb) - an attempt to use a symbolic solver to find the IK of a human, it didn't work well. \n",
